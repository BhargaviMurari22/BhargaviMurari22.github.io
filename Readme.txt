## Individual Project 1 Report:

## The Overview and Outcomes:
I've crafted a professional personal website on GitHub Pages using an open-source CSS template (Bootstrap), targeting potential employers with a clean design. The site includes a detailed resume, introduces a "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course, and integrates jQuery, a JavaScript framework, and two public Web APIs. JavaScript cookies enhance user interactivity, and a page tracker provides insights.

### Part 1: Basic JavaScript Implementation
Firstly, I improve user interaction by integrating some basic JavaScript functionality for interactive activities such as showing analog and digital clocks and dynamically exposing or hiding email addresses. This enhances the user experience overall by adding dynamic and intuitive aspects. I use the CSS Bootstrap framework to offer the best viewing experience across a range of devices, which makes the website design responsive and flexible. The smooth fusion of JavaScript improvements and Bootstrap responsiveness makes for a more interesting and intuitive online experience.

### Part 2: Integration of APIs and Advanced Features
Secondly, I integrate APIs to improve the website's functionality and data resources. I use weatherbit.io and other services to get real-time weather data. Investigating frameworks such as React.js adds even more functionality and produces an engaging, dynamic user interface. Cookie storage provides a smooth and customized user experience by maintaining session data between sessions. The combination of cookie storage, framework exploration, and API connectivity provides a feature-rich and improved user experience on the website.
